Mirror LAB. The Integrated Museum Network within the Historical Urban Landscape of Rome - A Prototype for Infrastructure Development with Advanced Digital Applications in the Virtual Laboratory Comprising the Vast Renaissance and Baroque Collections: Ludovisi and Altemps

*European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)*

*Regional Operational Programme of Lazio*

*Objective:*

The Mirror LAB project aligns itself with the DTC project "The Interactive Virtual Museum of Renaissance Archaeological and Artistic Collecting," conceived, promoted, and coordinated by the National Roman Museum - Palazzo Altemps. Consequently, it furnishes a series of innovative tools for the enhancement and enjoyment of the public museum heritage housed within the noble palaces of Rome. It will establish the cultural and technical foundations for the creation of a network of museum and urban poles structured as a context of attractions, interwoven within an ICT system of guided tours imbued with relational, documentary, cultural, historical, and spectacular significance. The museum poles, the art objects they preserve, and the historical-artistic attractions composing the urban context shall be the protagonists of digital narratives of the Historical Urban Landscape of Rome, as waypoints in a journey centered on heritage and the reconstruction of both real and virtual places.
